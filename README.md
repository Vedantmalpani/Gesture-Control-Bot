# Gesture-Cont
A gesture Controlled bot, as the name suggests, is a non-autonomous bot controlled by hand gestures that is
communicated to it via signals sent by accelerometer. The movement of accelerometer provides certain
coordinates that are processed by our micro-controller (Arduino UNO) and then provided to the bot as input.
The bot then provides the output depending upon the threshold set by the user while programming it.
